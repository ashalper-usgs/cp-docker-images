# Overview

This demo deploys an active-active multi-datacenter design, with two instances of Confluent Replicator copying data bidirectionally between the datacenters.
Confluent Control Center is running to manage and monitor the cluster.

This Docker environment is for demo purposes only, not for production.

## Data generation and topic names

| Datagen Docker container | Origin DC | Origin topics    | Replicator instance          | Destination DC | Destination topics |
|--------------------------|-----------|------------------|------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| datagen-dc1-topic1       | dc1       | topic1,_schemas  | replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic1 | dc2            | topic1,_schemas    |
| datagen-dc1-topic2       | dc1       | topic2           | replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic2 | dc2            | topic2.replica     |
| datagen-dc2-topic1       | dc2       | topic1           | replicator-dc2-to-dc1-topic1 | dc1            | topic1             |


Confluent Replicator (version 5.0.1 and higher) prevents cyclic repetition of data between the dc1 `topic1` and dc2 `topic1` by using provenance information in the message headers.

# Monitor Replicator performance

Monitoring Replicator is important to:

1. Gauge how synchronized is the data between multiple datacenters
2. Optimize performance of the network and Confluent Platform


## Multi-datacenter

In this multi-datacenter environment, there are two Apache Kafka<sup>Â®</sup> clusters, `dc1` and `dc2`.
Confluent Control Center manages both of these clusters.
Confluent Replicator is copying data bidirectionally between `dc1` and `dc2`, but for simplicity in explaining how it works, the following sections consider replication only from `dc1` to `dc2`.

1. After starting the demo (see [previous section](#start-the-services), navigate your Chrome browser to the Control Center UI at http://localhost:9021 and verify in the dropdown that there are two Kafka clusters `dc1` and `dc2`:

![image](images/c3-two-clusters.png)

2. This demo has two Kafka Connect clusters, `connect-dc1` and `connect-dc2`. Recall that Replicator is a source connector that typically runs on the connect cluster at the destination, so `connect-dc1` runs Replicator copying from `dc2` to `dc1`, and `connect-dc2` runs Replicator copying from `dc1` to `dc2`. At this time, Control Center can manage only one Kafka Connect cluster, and since we are explaining replication only from `dc1` to `dc2`, in this demo Control Center manages the connect workers only in `connect-dc2`.

3. For Replicator copying from `dc1` to `dc2`: navigate to http://localhost:9021/management/connect/ to verify that Kafka Connect (configured to `connect-dc2`) is running two instances of Replicator: [replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic1](submit_replicator_dc1_to_dc2.sh) and [replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic2](submit_replicator_dc1_to_dc2_topic2.sh).

## Streams Monitoring

Control Center's monitoring capabilities include monitoring stream performance: verifying that all data is consumed and at what throughput and latency.
Monitoring can be displayed on a per-consumer group or per-topic basis.
Confluent Replicator has an embedded consumer that reads data from the origin cluster, so you can monitor its performance in Control Center.
To enable streams monitoring for Replicator, configure it with the [Monitoring Consumer Interceptor](https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/installation/clients.html), as shown in this [example](submit_replicator_dc1_to_dc2.sh).

![image](images/replicator-embedded-consumer.png)

3. Navigate to http://localhost:9021/monitoring/streams/ and select the `dc1` Kafka cluster in the dropdown. Verify that there are two consumer groups, one for reach Replicator instance running from `dc1` to `dc2`, called `replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic1` and `replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic2`:

![image](images/c3-streams-dc-1.png)

4. Navigate to http://localhost:9021/monitoring/streams/ and select the `dc2` Kafka cluster in the dropdown. Verify that there is one consumer group running from `dc2` to `dc1` called `replicator-dc2-to-dc1-topic1`:

![image](images/c3-streams-dc-2.png)

## Consumer Lag

Replicator has an embedded consumer that reads data from the origin cluster, and it commits its offsets only after the connect worker's producer has committed the data to the destination cluster (configure the frequency of commits with the parameter ``offset.flush.interval.ms``).
You can monitor the consumer lag of Replicator's embedded consumer in the origin cluster (for Replicator instances copying data from `dc1` to `dc2`, the origin cluster is `dc1`).
The ability to monitor Replicator's consumer lag is enabled when it is configured with `offset.topic.commit=true` (`true` by default), which allows Replicator to commit its own consumer offsets to the origin cluster `dc1` after the messages have been written to the destination cluster.

5. For Replicator copying from `dc1` to `dc2`: Navigate to http://localhost:9021/monitoring/consumer/lag and select `dc1` (origin cluster) in the cluster dropdown.
Verify that there are two consumer groups, one for reach Replicator instance running from `dc1` to `dc2`: `replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic1` and `replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic2`. Replicator's consumer lag information is available in Control Center and `kafka-consumer-groups`, but it is not available via JMX.

a. Click on `replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic1` to view Replicator's consumer lag in reading `topic1` and `_schemas` (equivalent to `docker-compose exec broker-dc1 kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server broker-dc1:9091 --describe --group replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic1`)

![image](images/c3-consumer-lag-dc1-topic1.png)

b. Click on `replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic2` to view Replicator's consumer log in reading `topic2` (equivalent to `docker-compose exec broker-dc1 kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server broker-dc1:9091 --describe --group replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic2`)

![image](images/c3-consumer-lag-dc1-topic2.png)

6. For Replicator copying from `dc1` to `dc2`: do not mistakingly try to monitor Replicator consumer lag in the destination cluster `dc2`. Control Center also shows the Replicator consumer lag for topics in `dc2` (i.e., `topic1`, `_schemas`, `topic2.replica`) but this does not mean that Replicator is consuming from them. The reason you see this consumer lag in `dc2` is because by default Replicator is configured with `offset.timestamps.commit=true` for which Replicator commits its own offset timestamps of its consumer group in the `__consumer_offsets` topic in the destination cluster `dc2`. In case of disaster recovery, this enables Replicator to resume where it left off when switching to the secondary cluster.

7. Do not confuse consumer lag with an MBean attribute called `records-lag` associated with Replicator's embedded consumer.
That attribute reflects whether Replicator's embedded consumer can keep up with the original data production rate, but it does not take into account replication lag producing the messages to the destination cluster.
`records-lag` is real time, and it is normal for this value to be `0.0`.

```bash
$ docker-compose exec connect-dc2 kafka-run-class kafka.tools.JmxTool --object-name "kafka.consumer:type=consumer-fetch-manager-metrics,partition=0,topic=topic1,client-id=replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic1-0" --attributes "records-lag" --jmx-url service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://connect-dc2:9892/jmxrmi
```


# Resume applications after failover

After a disaster event occurs, switch your Java consumer application to a different datacenter, and then it can automatically restart consuming data in the destination cluster where it left off in the origin cluster.

To use this capability, configure Java consumer applications with the [Consumer Timestamps Interceptor](https://docs.confluent.io/current/multi-dc-replicator/replicator-failover.html#configuring-the-consumer-for-failover), which is shown in this [sample code](src/main/java/io/confluent/examples/clients/ConsumerMultiDatacenterExample.java).


1. After starting this Docker environment (see [previous section](#start-the-services), run the consumer to connect to the `dc1` Kafka cluster. It automatically configures the consumer group ID as `java-consumer-topic1` and uses the Consumer Timestamps Interceptor and Monitoring Interceptor.

```bash
mvn clean package
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=io.confluent.examples.clients.ConsumerMultiDatacenterExample -Dexec.args="topic1 localhost:29091 http://localhost:8081 localhost:29092"
```

Verify in the consumer output that it is reading data originating from both dc1 and dc2:

```bash
...
key = User_1, value = {"userid": "User_1", "dc": "dc1"}
key = User_9, value = {"userid": "User_9", "dc": "dc2"}
key = User_6, value = {"userid": "User_6", "dc": "dc2"}
...
```

2. Even though the consumer is consuming from dc1, there are dc2 consumer offsets committed for the consumer group `java-consumer-topic1`. Run the following command to read from the `__consumer_offsets` topic in dc2.

```bash
$ docker-compose exec broker-dc2 kafka-console-consumer --topic __consumer_offsets --bootstrap-server localhost:29092 --formatter "kafka.coordinator.group.GroupMetadataManager\$OffsetsMessageFormatter" | grep java-consumer
```

Verify that there are committed offsets:

```bash
...
[java-consumer-topic1,topic1,0]::OffsetAndMetadata(offset=1142, leaderEpoch=Optional.empty, metadata=, commitTimestamp=1547146285084, expireTimestamp=None)
[java-consumer-topic1,topic1,0]::OffsetAndMetadata(offset=1146, leaderEpoch=Optional.empty, metadata=, commitTimestamp=1547146286082, expireTimestamp=None)
[java-consumer-topic1,topic1,0]::OffsetAndMetadata(offset=1150, leaderEpoch=Optional.empty, metadata=, commitTimestamp=1547146287084, expireTimestamp=None)
...
```


3. When [Confluent Monitoring Interceptors](https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/installation/clients.html) are configured on Kafka clients, they write metadata to a topic called `_confluent-monitoring`.
   Kafka clients include any application that uses the Apache Kafka client API to connect to Kafka brokers, such as custom client code or any service that has embedded producers or consumers, such as Kafka Connect, KSQL, or a Kafka Streams application.
   Control Center uses that topic to ensure that all messages are delivered and to provide statistics on throughput and latency performance.
   From that same topic, you can also derive which producers are writing to which topics and which consumers are reading from which topics, and an example [script](map_topics_clients.py) is provided with the repo (note: this is for demo purposes only, not suitable for production).

```bash
./map_topics_clients.py
```

In steady state with the Java consumer running, you should see:

```bash
Reading topic _confluent-monitoring for 60 seconds...please wait

__consumer_timestamps
  producers
    consumer-1
    producer-10
    producer-11
    producer-6
    producer-8
  consumers
    replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic1
    replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic2
    replicator-dc2-to-dc1-topic1

_schemas
  producers
    connect-worker-producer-dc2
  consumers
    replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic1

topic1
  producers
    connect-worker-producer-dc1
    connect-worker-producer-dc2
    datagen-dc1-topic1
    datagen-dc2-topic1
  consumers
    java-consumer-topic1
    replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic1
    replicator-dc2-to-dc1-topic1

  producers
    datagen-dc1-topic2
  consumers
    replicator-dc1-to-dc2-topic2

topic2.replica
  producers
    connect-worker-producer-dc2
```

4. Shut down dc1:

```bash
$ docker-compose stop connect-dc1 schema-registry-dc1 broker-dc1 zookeeper-dc1
```

5. Stop and restart the consumer to connect to the `dc2` Kafka cluster. It will still use the same consumer group ID `java-consumer-topic1` so it can resume where it left off:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=io.confluent.examples.clients.ConsumerMultiDatacenterExample -Dexec.args="topic1 localhost:29092 http://localhost:8082 localhost:29092"
```

You should see data sourced only from `dc2`:

```bash
...
key = User_8, value = {"userid": "User_8", "dc": "dc2"}
key = User_9, value = {"userid": "User_9", "dc": "dc2"}
key = User_5, value = {"userid": "User_5", "dc": "dc2"}
...
```
